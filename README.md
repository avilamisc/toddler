#TODDLER

The purpose of this app is to showcase a working example for using Dagger 2, Retrofit 2, Logansquare, Kotlin, RxJava, Otto and Stetho (for debugging) on Android.

The sample Android app syncs to a Jira server, fetches all unresolved issues and displays them in a list or grid depending on the form factor.
Login data and server settings can be changed in the settings.
The app contains some bloat generated by the Android code templates.
This should be cleaned up in the future.

If you don't have access to a Jira server you can create a trial account on https://jira.atlassian.com and use this server to try out the app.
